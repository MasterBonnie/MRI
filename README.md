# MRI and Deep Learning
Repository containing code for a project about inverse problems in imaging. It combines ideas from Compressed Sensing MRI and Deep Learing to augment the inverse problem of MRI, incorporating a data-driven approach. Its based (primarily) on the papers [(1)]( https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.21391) and [(2)](https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493320). The masks are created using code from [this repository](https://github.com/sifeluga/PDvdi). Below is the abstract of the report of that was part of this project:

This paper looked into techniques used to accelerate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by investigating well-known methods in compressed sensing MRI (CS-MRI) and how to incorporate a deep learning approach along side or in combination with the CS-MRI approach. A benchmark was made through classic CS-MRI, which involves solving a regularized inverse problem. Furthermore, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to learn the mapping between a zero-filled reconstruction of undersampled k-space data and the original reconstruction from fully sampled k-space data. The neural network was applied as an initialization to the CS-MRI approach or added as an additional regularization term to the minimization problem. The results show a noticeable improvement in the reconstructed images using this approach.
